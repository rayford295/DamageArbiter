# 🌪️ DamageArbiter: A CLIP-Enhanced Multimodal Arbitration Framework for Hurricane Damage Assessment from Street-View Imagery

This repository contains the implementation, figures, and dataset links for the paper:  
**“DamageArbiter: A CLIP-Enhanced Multimodal Arbitration Framework for Hurricane Damage Assessment from Street-View Imagery.”**

## 📘 Overview

This study proposes a **Disagreement-driven Arbitration Framework** designed to improve the interpretability, reliability, and accuracy of street-view-based disaster damage assessment.  
It systematically combines **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)** representations, supported by **LLM-generated disaster annotations**.

</p>

The framework integrates:
- Vision-based feature extraction (ViT)
- LLM-assisted textual annotation generation
- CLIP-based cross-modal alignment
- Confidence-based arbitration for explainable disaster damage prediction
